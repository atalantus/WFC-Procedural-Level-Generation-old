# Wave-function-collapse algorithm with Unity
This Unity example project utilizes the wave-function-collapse algorithm to procedurally generate levels in a three-dimensional grid.

**For a simpler implementation of the algorithm on a two-dimensional grid see [this project](https://github.com/atalantus/WFC-Unity-Example).**
